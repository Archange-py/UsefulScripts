# Useful Script


This repository contains a collection of more or less useful scripts, including major algorithms in the computer world, useful classes, and other python projects.

> It will be added to over time.

They were made by myself, during my NSI specialization classes, and in my spare time. Some projects are the result of collaboration, in which case the people involved are indicated in the script.

You can use the [requirement.txt](requirements.txt) file to install the necessary dependencies for the various projects.

  ⚠️ Warning ⚠️ Not all scripts are finished, nor do they include a clear, factorized implementation: they will be as they are updated.
